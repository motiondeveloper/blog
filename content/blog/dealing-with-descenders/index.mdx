It's common when creating After Effects templates (such as lower thirds) to set the size of a rectangle based on a text layer. This is so the box will grow to match the size of the layer, no matter the text content.

![Setting a box size based off the text height plus padding](text-template-padding.png)

<Inform>

You do this by basing the width and height of the rectangle on the size of the text layer, plus a padding value, with the either the `js›sourceRectAtTime()` [method](/blog/basics-native-methods) or `js›width` and `js›height` layer [attributes](/blog/basics-native-attributes).

</Inform>

## The problem

Setting the rectangle height from the text height causes issues, as letters with **descenders** (`js›"y, g, j"`) or **ascenders** (`js›"h, f, l"`) will cause the height to fluctuate as the copy changes.

<LocalVideo videoName="box-size-from-text-height" title="Box height fluctuations when using the text height"/>

Sometimes this is what the design requires, but in most cases it's preferable to set the rectangle height from the **cap height** rather than the height of the text layer.

<Inform>

**Cap height** is the height of flat topped capital letters, such as `js›"H"`, `js›"I"` and `js›"X"`.

</Inform>

### Cap height

Since the cap height is a consistent value across all letters, setting the height of the rectangle **based on the cap height** means the size won't change when the text contains descenders or ascenders.

Rather than writing the cap height value into the expression (which means updating the value on any design changes), you can instead **measure the cap height of the text layer**.

<Note>

One method of getting a fixed height of a text layer is by **accessing the text style properties** `js›fontSize` and `js›leading`.

Since descenders and ascenders also change the bounding box of a text layer (and thus any positional expressions) we've found the method below more robust.

</Note>

## Replacing lines with "X"

Measuring the height of this descender less version gives us a consistent value, regardless of descenders, and changes with text style.

To replace the lines with X, you need to get the number of lines.

Won't explain this in depth.

```js
// Count the number of lines
const numLines = Math.max(
    value.split(/[^\r\n\3]*/gm).length - 1,
    0
  );
```

<Inform>

Also available in our function library, [aeFunctions](/blog/using-aefunctions), `js›aef.textCount(value, "lines")`.


</Inform>

You then need to repeat the "X" for each line.

```js{6}
const numLines = Math.max(
    value.split(/[^\r\n\3]*/gm).length - 1,
    0
  );
// Repeat X for each line
'X\r'.repeat(numLines - 1) + 'X'
```

## Hiding in time

The text needs to be the text. So we use a technique of hiding the "X" version in negative time, and then sampling the height at that time.

```js
const numLines = Math.max(
    value.split(/[^\r\n\3]*/gm).length - 1,
    0
  );

if (time < 500) {
  // Use Xs if negative time
  'X\r'.repeat(numLines - 1) + 'X';
} else {
  // Otherwise the original text
  value;
}
```

Now during the span of the compositions, it's the value, but if we use `js›sourceRectAtTime(-550)` we'll get the sourceRect of the X layers.

<Note>

It's best to measure a bit before, not exactly 500.

</Note>

So get the height at negative time, and width at current time.

<Inform>

Also available in our function library, [aeFunctions](/blog/using-aefunctions), `js›aef.hideDescenders(value)`.

</Inform>

## How we use it

General technique, not exact expressions. Can be used however you want to make your rectangle.

This can be a lot of repetitive code, so we've implemented the idea in [aeFunctions](/blog/using-aefunctions).

### Text Layer

Just need to hide descenders.

```js
const aef = footage('aefunctions.jsx')
  .sourceData
  .getFunctions();

aef.hideDescenders();
```

### Box Path

Get position and size of text layer, and create rectangles. `js›layerRect()` handles getting the height from negative time with the `js›descenderText` attribute.

`js›eBox` is a library to easily create and scale rectangles for templates.

```js
const eBox = footage("eBox.jsx").sourceData;
const aef = footage('aefunctions.jsx')
  .sourceData
  .getFunctions();

const textLayer = thisComp.layer('TXT_Copy');
const textRect = aef.layerRect({
  layer: textLayer,
  anchor: 'center',
  descendersText: true,
});

const padding = 36;

const myBox = eBox.createBox({
  size: add(textRect.size, [padding, padding]),
  position: textRect.position,
  anchor: 'center',
});

myBox.getPath();
```
