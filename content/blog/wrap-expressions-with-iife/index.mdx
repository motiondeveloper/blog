It can be difficult to determine what the final value for an expression is, especially when:

- It's more than a few lines long
- You didn't write it (or you wrote it a while ago)
- It doesn't have comments

For example, can you tell what value is set in the below example?

```js
const myPosition = [960, 540];
myPosition * 2;
[0, 0];
const otherPosition = [500, 500];
```

<Successful>

```js
[0, 0];
```

</Successful>

Knowing which value is set requires reading through and understanding **the whole expression**.

To learn more about what determines the final value for an expression, see our article on [statement completion values](/blog/basics-statement-completion-values).

## Using a return statement

Ideally you would be able to use a `js›return` statement, as if the expression was the body of a [function](/blog/basics-functions):

```js{3}
const myPosition = [960, 540];
myPosition * 2;
return [0, 0];
const otherPosition = [500, 500];
```

<Successful>

```js
[0, 0];
```

</Successful>

Which has the benefit of **explicitly** setting what value is used, allowing you to scan an expression for the `js›return` keyword and work backwards from the final value.

<Note>

You can learn more about `js›return` statements in our article on [functions](/blog/basics-functions).

</Note>

### Other benefits

Using `js›return` statements has more benefits than just being explicit, for example:

- Skipping code with early returns, without needing an `js›else` clause

  ```js
  if (test) {
    return someValue;
  }

  // more complicated code
  return somethingElse;
  ```

- Ending an expression with a [function](/blog/basics-functions) declaration

  ```js
  return bounce(3, 2);
  function bounce(...) {}
  ```

- Avoiding polluting the global scope when using `js›var` declarations

## Wrapping expressions in a function

Using a `js›return` statement in an expression will result in an error, as they aren't allowed outside of a function body:

```js
return 'Use this for the final value';
```

<Errorful>

```js
Error: Syntax Error: Illegal return statement
```

</Errorful>

To get around this you need to wrap your expression in a [function](/blog/basics-functions) and then call it, for example:

```js
function main() {
  return 'Hello from return';
}

main();
```

<Successful>

```js
'Hello from return';

```

</Successful>

### IIFEs

While this works well, you can reduce the amount of syntax needed by using an **IIFE**.

<Inform>

IIFE stands for **Immediately Invoked Function Expression**.

</Inform>

This is a method for invoking the [function](/blog/basics-functions) as soon as it's created, by:

1. Wrapping an anonymous function in parenthesis (`js›()`)

2. Followed by another pair of parenthesis to call it

For example:

```js
(function () {
  return someValue;
})();
```

<Note>

You make a function anonymous by omitting it's name, which normally comes after the `js›function` keyword.

</Note>

You can then further reduce the amount of code by changing the function to an ES6 arrow function:

```js
(() => {
  return 'Returned!';
})();
```

<Successful>

```js
'Returned!';

```

</Successful>

This allows you to gain the benefits of using `js›return` statements in your expressions, with minimal syntactical overhead.

For example, the expression from the top of this post becomes:

```js
(() => {
  const myPosition = [960, 540];
  myPosition * 2;
  return [0, 0];
  const otherPosition = [500, 500];
})();
```

<Successful>

```js
[0, 0];
```

</Successful>

Where it's now clear what value is being used as the result of the expression.

<Note>

This isn't something you _need_ to do on every expression, but rather another technique to keep your expressions easy to read and understand.

</Note>

While the examples in this post have been simple, the benefits are especially true when it comes to longer and more complicated expressions.
