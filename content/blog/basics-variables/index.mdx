## Variables as pointers

When writing any expression you will need to manipulate and store pieces of data such as numbers, text, or booleans (`js›true`/`js›false`). For example, setting the following expression on the `Source Text` property of a text layer.

```js
'Hello world'
```

This will cause the text layer to show 'Hello World'. If you want to use this data throughout your expression, writing `js›'Hello World'` each time means would become time consuming.

```js
if (time < 5) {
  'Hello world';
} else if (time < 10) {
  'Hello world' + ' welcome to';
} else {
  'Hello world' + ' welcome to' + ' expressions';
}
```
<Note>

If you don't understand the other parts of this expression, don't worry! We'll get to them in the following posts in the series.

</Note>

Instead of using the data directly, variables allow you to create a *named reference* which you then use throughout the expression.

It's important to note that a variable isn't the data itself, but rather a pointer to that piece of data. When the JavaScript engine (what runs the code) encounters one, it looks to see what the variable is pointing to then uses and that value accordingly.

While this might not seem like an important distinction now, it will be as you move on to more advanced topics.

## Declaring variables

Before you can use a variable you need to create (or declare) it by using the JavaScript keyword `js›let`, followed by the variable name.

<Inform>

A keyword (or reserved word) is any word that has a special meaning in the language.

</Inform>

```js
let myText; // Variable declaration
```

Once you've declared a variable, you can retrieve the data it points to by writing it's name.

```js{2}
let myText;
myText;
```

If you apply this expression on `Source Text` you'll see that your text layer is still empty. That's because while you have created the variable, it doesn't have a value assigned to it yet.

### Naming variables

There's some limitations apply when naming variables, as well as some best practices to keep in mind.

Some names that aren't allowed are:

- Names starting with a number
- Reserved words such as `js›if`, `js›function`, or `js›for` (you can find a full list of reserved words [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords))

<Inform>

It's best to give variables a descriptive name and not single letters or numbers. This will make your code much easier for other people, or your future self, to read.

</Inform>

The convention is to write variable names in lower camel case, where you capitalize the first letter of every word except for the first one, such as `js›myText`, `js›animationDuration`, or `js›currentLayerWidth`.

### Undefined vs is not defined

JavaScript gives variables that don't point to anything a special value called `js›undefined`.

It's important to note that this is different to when you try to access a variable that isn't declared, in which case you will get the error `js›variable is not defined`. You can test this by modifying your expression to:

```js{2}
let myText;
(myText === undefined); // true
```

<Successful>

```js
true
```

</Successful>

Will show the value `js›true`, while the expression:

```js
(myText === undefined); // Throws an error
```

<Errorful>

```js
Error: myText is not defined
```

</Errorful>

Will give the error `js›myText is not defined`, since you've tried to access a variable that isn't declared.

## Assigning their value

Once you've declared a variable, you can give it a value by writing it's name followed by the equals sign (`js›=`) and then the value you want to give it. Assigning a variable's value the first time is called 'initializing' that variable.

```js{2}
let myText;
myText = 'Hello world'; // Variable initialization
```

If you now use the variable `js›myText`, it's value is returned and set as the `Source Text` of the text layer.

```js{3}
let myText;
myText = 'Hello world';
myText;
```

<Successful>

```js
'Hello world'
```

</Successful>

You can shorten the expression by declaring and initializing in the same line, which is what's done the majority of the time.

```js
let myText = 'Hello world';
myText;
```

<Successful>

```js
'Hello world'
```

</Successful>

## Updating variables

As suggested by their name, you can change the value that a variable points to at any place in the expression by using the equals (`js›=`) sign:

```js{2}
let myText = 'Hello world';
myText = 'Hello JavaScript!'; // Change myText variable
myText;
```

<Successful>

```js
'Hello JavaScript!'
```

</Successful>

Which will display 'Hello JavaScript!' on the text layer.

## Data types

There are specific **types** of data that you can store in variables, which we will explore in depth in future articles. In short, there is:

- **Number**, such as `js›8` or `js›12.653`, which you can perform mathematical calculations on

- **String**, which are pieces of text such as our 'Hello world' example. Strings must be wrapped in single (`js›''`) or double (`js›""`) quotes so JavaScript knows you're not trying to access a variable

- **Boolean**, which you can think of like switches, as they can either have the value `js›true` of `js›false` (notice these are not wrapped in quotes)

- More complex data types such as Object, Null, Undefined, and Symbols

```js
546.8 // Number
'Hello!' // String
false // Boolean
```

<Inform>

In JavaScript variables themselves don't have a type, only they data they refer to.

</Inform>

## Var vs let

You might be wondering why we've been using `js›let` so far, and what happened to `js›var`.

`js›let` is a new way to declare variables available in modern versions of JavaScript (such as what is used in CC2019). It's introduced to be a more strict alternative to `js›var`, which will allow you create and use variables in ways which could cause confusion or hard to diagnose bugs.

We won't cover the differences between the two in this post, but for now all you need to know is it's best to use `js›let` in your expressions.

## Constants

We've been using `js›let` to declare variables, which as the name suggests, allow you to change the value at any point in the expression.

You can also create what's called a **constant**, which behaves much like a variable except that you cannot reassign it's value once it has been initialized. It's a *read only variable*.

We do this by using the keyword `js›const` instead of `js›let`.

```js{2}
const myText = 'Hello world';
myText;
```

If we tried to reassign the value of `js›myText`, we would get the error 'Assignment to constant variable'.

```js{2}
const myText = 'Hello world';
myText = 'Hello globe'; // Returns error
```

<Errorful>

```js
Error: Assignment to constant variable
```

</Errorful>

<Note>

It's important to note that while you can't change what value a constant references (points to), the underlying value can still be modifed.

For example if you had a constant that pointed to a 'person', you couldn't change which person it referenced, but you could change that persons characteristics such as their height or weight.

</Note>

### Why use a constant

It may be tempting to use `js›let` instead of `js›const` throughout your expressions since it's more flexible. However it's much easer to understand what's happening in an expression when you know the value of a variable isn't going to, or hasn't been, changed.

For example, if you had this expression on a `Source Text` property:

```js
let dialog = 'Hello World';

if (time > 10) {
  dialog = 'Goodbye World';
}

dialog;
```

When reading this expression, you would need to go back and check where the last place the value of `js›dialog` had been changed was to know what your text would be. In larger expressions with more complex flows, this can be difficult.

If a constant is used instead you can be confidant in the value of each variable without having to look through the entire expression.

```js
const helloDialog = 'Hello World';
const goodbyeDialog = 'Goodbye World';

if (time > 10) {
  goodbyeDialog;
} else {
  helloDialog;
}
```

This might seem trivial in this example, but it's a good habit to always use `js›const` where possible.

## Wrapping up

Now you know how to use `js›let` and `js›const` to create and use variables, as well as best practices that will help you as you go on to write more complex expressions.
