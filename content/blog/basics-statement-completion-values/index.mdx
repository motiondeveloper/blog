  Learn what statement completion values are and how they control what value your expression evaluates to.

import { Note, Inform, Warn } from 'components/callout';
import { Successful, Errorful } from 'components/codeOutput'

When there's multiple lines in your expression, it's important to know which value After Effects will use for the property once the code is evaluated.

For example in the expression:

```js
const myPosition = [960, 540];
myPosition * 2;
[0, 0];
const otherPosition = [500, 500];
```

<Successful>

```js
0, 0
```

</Successful>

The value `js›[0, 0]` will be used, but why?

## Completion values

In an expression you perform actions such as assigning values to variables, calling functions or performing math. These actions are called 'statements'. In JavaScript, every statement has whats called a **completion value**.

Statements such as variable declarations (`js›const myVariable = 2;`) and function declarations have a completion value of `empty`. 

Expression statements, such as:

```js
[960, 540];
Math.random();
"Hello";
```

Have a completion value that is the result of the expression.

<Inform>

The value for the property will be the last completion value that isn't `empty`.

</Inform>

So if we consider the completion values of each statement in our earlier expression:

```js
const myPosition = [960, 540]; // empty
myPosition * 2; // [1920, 1080]
[0, 0]; // [0, 0]
const otherPosition = [500, 500]; // empty
```

<Successful>

```js
0, 0
```

</Successful>

You can see that `js›[0, 0]` will be used as it's the last statement with a non-empty completion value.

This will be important as you write more complex expressions.
