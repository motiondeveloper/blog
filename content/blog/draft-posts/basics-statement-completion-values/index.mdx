  Learn what statement completion values are and how they control what value your expression evaluates to.
---

When there's multiple lines in your expression, it's important to know which value After Effects will use for the property once the code is evaluated.

For example in the expression:

```js
const myPosition = [960, 540];
myPosition * 2;
[0, 0];
const otherPosition = [500, 500];
```

The value `js›[0, 0]` will be used, but why?

## Completion values

In JavaScript, every statement (which can be thought of as lines for the moment) has whats called a **completion value**.

Statements such as variable declarations (`js›const myVariable = 2;`) and function declarations have a completion value of `empty`. 

Expression statements, such as:

```js
[960, 540];
Math.random();
"Hello";
```

Have a completion value that is the result of the expression.

> The value for the property will be the **last completion value that isn't `empty`**

So if we consider the completion values of each statement in our earlier expression:

```js
const myPosition = [960, 540]; // empty
myPosition * 2; // [1920, 1080]
[0, 0]; // [0, 0]
const otherPosition = [500, 500]; // empty
```

You can see that `js›[0, 0]` will be used as it's the last statement with a non-empty completion value.

This will be important as you write more complex expressions.
