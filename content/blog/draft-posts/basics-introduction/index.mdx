Expressions are hard to learn. You find that perfect bit of code on Creative Cow only to realize it doesn't work in your project. You google your problem to find a confusing answer on Stack Overflow.

This course breaks down expressions into their fundamental components, building a solid foundation that will help you *understand* the code that you write.

By the end of the course you'll have everything you need to be confident solving problems with expressions, no copy pasting needed!

## Course Content

The topics you'll in this course cover are:

- [Variables](../basics-variables)
- [Conditions](../basics-conditions)
- Referencing layers and compositions (coming soon)
- Native attributes (coming soon)
- Loops (coming soon)
- Functions (coming soon)
- Native methods (coming soon)
- Objects (coming soon)
- Arrays (coming soon)

## What are expressions?

In After Effects you can change a layers properties (such as position or opacity) by typing in or dragging the values, adding keyframes to change them over time. This process of changing and animating properties forms the basis of working in After Effects.

What if rather than setting a property manually, you need it to always be the same as another one?

Or you need it to *decide* what value to have based on something else?

This is where expressions come in, as an alternate way of setting the value of properties.

They enable you to combine values together and make automatic decisions about what that property should be.

This alternate way is by writing lines of code, in a language called **JavaScript**, that After Effects will run. The result of this code is then set as the value of the property.

> Expressions are lines of computer code that After Effects runs every frame to generate the value of a property.

## How to add an expression

You can add an expression to a property in After Effects by:

- Holding <kbd>alt</kbd> while clicking on the properties stop watch (the icon next to it's name)

- Using the 'Add Expression' shortcut <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>=</kbd> with the property selected

- Clicking <kbd>Add Expression</kbd> in the <kbd>Animation</kbd> menu

These will add a new expression with some placeholder code to the property.

This placeholder references the **before expression value**, which is the value of the property without any expression applied. This means you can continue to modify and animate the property as if there was no expression.

## Setting the value

You can overide the before expression value by typing in some JavaScript code that, when run, gives After Effects a value in the same structure (or [type](/basics-variables#data-types)) as the original.

For example, let's replace our position property expression with a new value.

```js
[960, 540];
```

> You'll learn more about the `js›[]` syntax in future topics

Now the postion of the layer will always be at `js›960, 540` even if we change or animate the property, as it is overidden by the expression.

Since we've written this value in JavaScript code, we can change and modify this value with math, or connect it to other properties in our project.

For example:

```js
[960 + 50, 540 + 100];
```

The rest of this course will cover the fundamentals of the JavaScript language and it's use within After Effects expressions.

### Statement completion values

When there's multiple lines in your expression, it's important to know which value After Effects will use for the property once the code is evaluated.

For example in the expression:

```js
const myPosition = [960, 540];
myPosition * 2;
[0, 0];
const otherPosition = [500, 500];
```

The value `js›[0, 0]` will be used, but why?

In JavaScript, every statement (which can be thought of as lines for the moment) has whats called a **completion value**.

Statements such as variable declarations (`js›const myVariable = 2;`) and function declarations have a completion value of `empty`. 

Expression statements, such as:

```js
[960, 540];
Math.random();
"Hello";
```

Have a completion value that is the result of the expression.

> The value for the property will be the **last completion value that isn't `empty`**

So if we consider the completion values of each statement in our earlier expression:

```js
const myPosition = [960, 540]; // empty
myPosition * 2; // [1920, 1080]
[0, 0]; // [0, 0]
const otherPosition = [500, 500]; // empty
```

You can see that `js›[0, 0]` will be used as it's the last statement with a non-empty completion value.

This will be more important as you write more complex expressions.
