In the [previous article](/blog/basics-introduction) you learnt that each property expects a value that is of a specific structure, or **type**. In this article you'll learn what those basics types are and what different properties expect.

## Overview

In JavaScript, each value is of a specific type. Which data type a value is defines how you interact with that value in your code.

In the same way, in After Effects the value of each property has a specific type, and your expression needs to return that same type in order to run without errors.

You can see what type a value is by writing `js›typeof value` in an expression (such as the 'Source Text' property of a text layer).

## Number

One of the most common types you will use is `js›Number`, such as `js›8` or `js›12.653`. 

```js
typeof 63;
```
<Successful>

```js
number
```

</Successful>

Numbers allow you to do mathematical operations such as add, subtract, divide and multiply them together, in the same way you're used to on a calculator.

```js
60 + (20 / 2);
```

<Successful>

```js
70
```

</Successful>


### Properties that expect numbers include:

- Opacity
- Slider Controls
- Separated positions (e.g. X Position, Y Position)
- Rotation


## Strings

Strings are pieces of text such as `js›"Jane Doe"` or `js›'After Effects'`.

```js
typeof "Hello!";
```
<Successful>

```js
string
```

</Successful>


Strings must be wrapped in single (`js›''`) or double (`js›""`) quotes so JavaScript knows you're not trying to access a [variable](/blog/basics-variables).

You can create a `js›String` with numbers in it, that isn't of a number type, by wrapping it in quotes, e.g. `js›"12.653"`

```js
typeof "12.653";
```
<Successful>

```js
string
```

</Successful>

### Properties that expect strings:

- Source Text

## Booleans

You can think of Booleans like switches, as they can either have the value `js›true` or `js›false` (notice these are not wrapped in quotes).

```js
typeof true;
```
<Successful>

```js
boolean
```

</Successful>

## Arrays

You'll notice that some properties expect more than one value, such as Position or Scale. You can think of these properties as expecting **a list of values that's a specific length**.
